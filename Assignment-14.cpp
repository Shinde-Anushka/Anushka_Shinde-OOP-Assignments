// 14. We want to store the information of different vehicles. Create a class named Vehicle with two data
//  member named mileage and price. Create its two subclasses
//  *Car with data members to store ownership cost, warranty (by years), seating capacity and fuel type
//  (diesel or petrol).
//  *Bike with data members to store the number of cylinders, number of gears, cooling type(air, liquid or
//  oil), wheel type(alloys or spokes) and fuel tank size(in inches)
//  Make another two subclasses Audi and Ford of Car, each having a data member to store the model
//  type. Next, make two subclasses Bajaj and TVS, each having a data member to store the make-type.
//  Now, store and print the information of an Audi and a Ford car (i.e. model type, ownership cost,
//  warranty, seating capacity, fuel type, mileage and price.) Do the same for a Bajaj and a TVS bike.
