//Q1 Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as savings and the
//other as current account. The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities
//but no chequebook facility. The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest. Current
//account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level a
//service charge is imposed. Create a class account that stores customer name, account number and type
//of account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their
//requirements. Include necessary member functions in order to achieve the following tasks:
//(a) Accept the deposit from a customer and update the balance.
//(b) Display the balance.
//(c) Compute and deposit interest.
//(d) Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
//(e) Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary and update the balance.
//Do not use any constructors. Use member functions to initialize class members.
